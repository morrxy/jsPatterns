<h1>primitive wrappers</h1>

<p>from book JavaScript Patterns pdf version, page 70</p>
<h2>One reason to use the wrapper objects is when you want to augment the value andpersist state. Because primitives are not objects, they cannot be augmented withproperties.</h2>

<pre>
// primitive string
var greet = "Hello there";

// primitive is converted to an object
// in order to use the split() method
console.log(greet.split(' ')[0]);

// attempting to augment a primitive is not an error
greet.smile = true;

// but it doesn't actually work
console.log(typeof greet.smile);
</pre>

<script>
// primitive string
var greet = "Hello there";

// primitive is converted to an object
// in order to use the split() method
console.log(greet.split(' ')[0]);

// attempting to augment a primitive is not an error
greet.smile = true;

// but it doesn't actually work
console.log(typeof greet.smile);
