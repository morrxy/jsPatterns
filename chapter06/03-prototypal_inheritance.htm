<h1>prototypal inheritance</h1>
<p>from book JavaScript Patterns pdf version, page 148</p>
<h2>Let’s start the discussion of “modern” classless patterns with a pattern called prototypal inheritance. In this pattern there are no classes involved; here objects inherit from other objects. You can think about it this way: you have an object that you would like to reuse and you want to create a second object that gets its functionality from the first one.</h2>

<script type="text/javascript">

function object(o) {
	function F() {}
	F.prototype = o;
	return new F();
}

// here's hwo you would go about this

// object to inherit from
var parent = {
	name: "Papa"
};

// the new object
var child = object(parent);

// testing
console.log(child.name); // "Papa"

</script>
